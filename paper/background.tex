To prevent a SAT solver from researching a symmetrical search tree, that was already solved
before, Symmetry Breaking Predicates can be added to the SAT
instance~\cite{sakallah2009symmetry}. SBPs can also be applied partially to the symmetry
group, called \textit{partial symmetry breaking}~\cite{sakallah2009symmetry}. Because
\textit{full symmetry breaking} sometimes costs a lot of time, most symmetrical search
spaces can be blocked by using a subset of the full SBP. There has been more research on
the efficiency of SBPs, such as~\cite{aloul2006efficient}\todo{More refs}.

\subsection{Terminology}
	As we build our research on the results of \cite{devriendt2012symmetry}, we will adopt
	their notation and terminology.

	Let \emph{a theory} $T$ be a SAT-instance in conjunctive normal form, i.e. a conjuction
	of clauses.
	Let $\Sigma(T)$ denote the set of variables in $T$.
	Every clause is a disjunction of \emph{literals}, where a literal is either of the form
	$x$ or $\neg x$, where $x \in \Sigma(T)$.
	$\bar\Sigma(T)$ denotes the set of all possible literals of $T$.

	An \emph{assignment} of $T$ is an $\alpha \subseteq \bar\Sigma(T)$, such that at most
	one literal for each variable in $T$ appears in $\alpha$.
	\emph{Partial} and \emph{complete} assignments are distinguished.
	An assignment is \emph{complete} if it contains one literal for each $x \in \Sigma(T)$.

	A literal $l$ can be evaluated against a assignment $\alpha$: $l$ is \emph{true} if $l \in
	\alpha$, \emph{false} if $\neg l \in \alpha$ and \emph{undefined} otherwise.
	Clauses are either \emph{satisfied} or \emph{in conflict} with an assignment $\alpha$.
	If a clause $C$ contains only false literals, then it is considered \emph{in conflict}.
	If $C$ contains at least one true literal, it is satisfied.
	Additionally $C$ is a \emph{unit-clause} if it only contains one true literal.

	A SAT-solver looks for a complete assignment such that all clauses in $T$ are satisfied.
	Such an assignment is called a model for $T$.
	A theory of $T$ is satisfiable if a model exists for $T$.
	Given a theory $T$, we consider a clause $c$ a \emph{logical consequence} of $T$ if
	$T \wedge c)$ is satisfied under every model of $T$; this is denoted as $T \vdash c$.
	A theory $T'$ is a logical consequence of $T$, if all clauses in $T$ are logical
	consequences of $T$.

	\todoi{This is almost directly taken from \cite{devriendt2012symmetry}. Is that a
	problem?}

	\todoi{Conflict-Driven symmetry breaking}

		Consider a permutation $\sigma$ of a theory $T$.
		$\sigma$ is called a symmetry if and only if:

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $\sigma(\neg x) = \neg(\sigma( x ))$
			\item $\sigma(\alpha )$ is a model for $T$ if and only if $\alpha$ is a model for
				$T$
		\end{enumerate}

		A crucial theorem concerning symmetries is the following: \\

		\begin{proposition}
			\label{prop:symmetric_clause_learning}
			Let $s$ be a symmetry of a theory $T$ and $c$ a clause.
			\begin{equation}
				T \vdash c \quad \implies \quad T \vdash \sigma( c )
			\end{equation}
		\end{proposition}

\subsection{Static Symmetry Breaking}
	Static symmetry breaking algorithms modify the input of the SAT solver, but do not
	adjust the solver itself~\cite{sakallah2009symmetry}.
	\todoi{Add some good static symmetry breaker and papers, e.g. Shatter)}

\subsection{Dynamic Symmetry Breaking}
	Dynamic symmetry breaking algorithms modify the SAT solver to search for local
	symmetries during runtime. Contributions to dynamic symmetry breaking have not been
	numerous in SAT such as \cite{sabharwal2005symchaff}, where Constraint Satisfaction
	Problems (CSP) have looked more research in the matter.

	One theoretical approach in dynamic symmetry breaking would be to exploit symmetries in
	a theory to learn more clauses.
	Every time the solver learns a clause $c$, $\sigma(c)$ could also be learned, according
	to proposition \ref{prop:symmetric_clause_learning}.
	This however is often not feasible, as it would add too many clauses to the theory.

	The alternative approach, which is taken by the authors of
	\cite{devriendt2012symmetry}, is to propagate symmetrical literals.
	The idea is that given a theory $T$, a partial assignment $\alpha$ and a symmetry
	$\sigma$ of $T \cup \alpha$, proposition \ref{prop:symmetric_clause_learning} implies
	that for any literal $l$:

	\begin{equation}
		T \cup \alpha \vdash l \quad
		\implies
		\quad T \cup \alpha \vdash \sigma(l)
	\end{equation}

	Thus, when the solver propagates a literal $l$, $\sigma(l)$ can also be propagated.
	\todo{what about $\sigma^2(l)$\ldots}.

	The challenge with this approach is to find symmetries of $T \cup \alpha$ in a
	reasonable time.
	To this end, the authors of \cite{devriendt2012symmetry} introduced the notion of
	\emph{weak activity}.
	Weakly active symmetries can be used to propagate symmetrical literals.
	Weak activity is defined as follows:\\

	\end{definition}
