Task: exploit symmetries to speed up solving SAT instances.
Background research: static and dynamic symmetry breaking
Static:
	Add clauses to input to prevent traversing symmetrical branches in the search tree.
	Downsides:
		several, most obvious: extra clauses might increase the input size too much.

Dynamic:
	Interact with the solver during search to avoid symmetrical search paths
