Symmetry breaking has become an interesting method for increasing the solving speed of
certain Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) Satisfiability (SAT) problems.
This is typically done by adding Symmetry Breaking Predicates (SBPs) to the SAT
instance~\cite{sakallah2009symmetry}, resulting in a more restricted search space.
For symmetry breaking to be applied effectively the given problem has to exert symmetrical
properties, i.e. some search tree is virtually identical to another.
Symmetry breaking has been shown to provide significant
speed-ups~\cite{darga2004exploiting,aloul2003solving}, and do not slow down the algorithm
when no obvious symmetries are present.

There are generally speaking two types of symmetry breaking: Static symmetry breaking and
dynamic symmetry breaking.
We will investigate the possibility of improving a dynamic symmetry breaker described by
\cite{devriendt2012symmetry}.
Their paper describes a symmetry breaker based on propagating symmetrical literals.
The solver therefor keeps track of symmetries that are applicable under the current assignment.
More applicable symmetries implies more propagated literals, which would suggest that
optimizing the solver for the number of applicable symmetries would yield improved results.
A step in this direction has been investigated by \cite{devriendt2012symmetry} and yielded
promising speedups.

In conflic-driven sat-solvers, the solver chooses in each iteration a value for an undefined
variable.
The performance of a solver depends heavily on choosing good variables and good values.
The predicate \emph{good} is often determined by a collection of heuristics in the solver.
Our research is focused on finding rules or heuristics that favor choosing literals
that optimize the number of applicable symmetries in a conflict-driven sat-solver.
