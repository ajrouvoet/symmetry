The implementation of the alternative heuristics is based on the improvements 
made by~\cite{devriendt2012symmetry} based on the MiniSAT SAT-solver.

The default heuristic implemented by~\cite{devriendt2012symmetry} orders the 
branching literals in a specific order. The implementations of the changed heuristics 
are partly based on this order, the computational heavy heuristics are only looking 
at the \emph{best} $n$ literals from this list.

In order to ease the testing procedure and overall usage of the solver, all heuristics
are implemented within the same program. One may choose one or multiple heuristics 
by using command line parameters. Because of this feature it is possible to combine 
multiple heuristics into a new heuristic. While benchmarking we incorporated a random
heuristic in all runs to keep the solver from looping forever around some local optimum.
Further combinations of heuristics are not tested because this falls outside the scope
of this research.
