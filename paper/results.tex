The implementation of the alternative heuristics is based on the improvements
made by~\cite{devriendt2012symmetry} based on the MiniSAT SAT-solver.
In order to ease the testing procedure and overall usage of the solver, all heuristics
are implemented within the same program. One may choose one or multiple heuristics
by using command line parameters. Because of this feature it is possible to combine
multiple heuristics into a new heuristic.
While benchmarking we disabled the builtin heuristic that randomly chooses a literal from the heap,
such that our results are fully deterministic.
Further combinations of heuristics are not tested because this falls outside the scope
of this research.

We will analyze the results for each of the heuristics seperately and discuss for each of them both
hypothesis as formulated in section \ref{sec:Introduction}.
Beforehand we discuss some results that are observed for each of the measured heuristics.

\subsection{Generic Results}
	It is observed in the activity data that none of implementations, including $SP^{OPT}$,
	succeeds in increasing the number of active symmetries in the CHNL benchmark suite.

\subsection{SA Heuristic}
	From a theoretical perspective, SA was expected to have the most impact on the number of active
	symmetries during search, as it optimizes is very directly using a one iteration lookahead.
	From the activity results this also becomes very
