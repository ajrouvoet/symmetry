Because all implemented heuristics are based on variable activity, it is possible to combine
multiple heuristics into a new heuristic.
We hypothesize that combining any of the proposed heuristics with the $SP^{OPT}$ heuristic based on
inverting literals, will result in better performance compared to the usage of any one of them
separately.

Furthermore, we formulated our conclusion on the falsification of the second hypothesis with care,
because e.g. the results of SA on the battleship suite was not convincingly negative.
It would be enlightening to further research the differences between the used benchmark suites and
correlate the results with different problem classes (satisfiable/unsatisfiable, many/few
symmetries, etc.).
