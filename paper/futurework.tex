Because all implemented heuristics are based on variable activity, it is possible to combine
multiple heuristics into a new heuristic.
We hypothesise that combining any of the proposed heurtics with the $SP^{OPT}$ heuristic based on
inverting literals, will result in better performance compared to the usage of any one of them
seperately.
