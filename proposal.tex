\section{Research Proposal}
\subsection{Topic and goals of the research}
The main topic of our research project is symmetry breaking in SAT. There are two types of symmetry breaking, static and dynamic. In this research project we will focus on the dynamic variant. Dynamic symmetry breaking involves interacting with the solver during search to try to avoid symmetrical search spaces that have already been visited. Static symmetry breaking, on the other hand, involves adding extra constraints to the input to avoid symmetrical search spaces, before it is fed to the solver.
