	\section{Research}
	As the subtitle suggests, our research focuses on symmetry breaking in satisfiability (SAT) solvers.

	We will study existing material on dynamic and static symmetry breaking and attempt to implement and/or extend such a dynamic method in minisat.

		\subsection{Research Questions}
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item What are the advantages and complications of an implementation of a generic dynamic	symmetry breaking algorithm in a SAT solver, compared to a static symmetry breaking implementation?
		\item How can we extend/modify the symmetry propagation algorithm used by~\cite{devriendt2012symmetry} to boost performance?
		\end{enumerate}

		\subsection{Motivation}
			As a research group we are focused on getting a better understanding of SAT solvers and methods of exploiting symmetry in SAT instances for improving the speed by which a SAT	instance can be solved.	Writing this paper is part of the course IN4077, which has as it's main objectives:

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item
					Apply combinatorial solvers to problem domains, and can compare and evaluate them.
				\item
					Explain general techniques used in combinatorial solvers
				\item
					Design and implement an extension or modification of a solver in order to answer the research question.
			\end{enumerate}

			Besides these goals, that we expect to be fulfilled by studying the material necessary to answer the formulated research question, there are a few additional goals formulated for the course:

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Formulate a research question on a provided topic.
				\item Communicate his/her findings effectively.
			\end{enumerate}

			These goals are fulfilled respectively by this document and the planned paper and the	presentation on our findings.

	\section{Context}
	There are two types of symmetry breaking, static and dynamic. Static symmetry breaking involves adding extra constraints to the input to avoid symmetrical search spaces, before it is fed to the solver. Dynamic symmetry breaking, on the other hand, involves interacting with the solver during search to try to avoid symmetrical search spaces that have already been visited.
	Currently, most dynamic symmetry breaking method for SAT perform worse than static symmetry breaking, or are limited to a specific class of symmetries~\cite{devriendt2012symmetry}. Therefor,~\cite{devriendt2012symmetry} proposed a symmetry propogation algorithm to overcome these difficulties. According to their results, their algorithm performs better than other state-of-the-art methods, for a number of different classes of symmetries.
